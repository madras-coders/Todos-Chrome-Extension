A very efficient note taking chrome extension which replaces the new tab in the browser to display the notes. 

We provide two options to take notes

1. Highlight the text in any webpage in any language and enter the shortcut keys or click on the toolbar extension icon to save the text to notes. 
2. Open a new tab and enter your notes manually. 

Two biggest advantages using this product. 1. With the option to select and save to notes, we make the notes taking very flexible and no need to toggle between multiple applications to take notes. 2. New tab displaying the notes will help users to remember the notes and to do tasks. 

Short cut keys to take notes are,

Windows -> Ctrl + E.
Mac -> Command + E.

Notes are stored and sync across the chrome browser where the user logged into. 

This is truly an open source application built to enhance the productivity. Your notes is saved in chrome storage and not sent anywhere outside the browser. We have our product roadmap and the planned release dates below. If you want to add any features please reach out to support@madrascoders.com or feel free to add on to the existing code.
